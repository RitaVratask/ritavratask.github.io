You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```


```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
        java.io.File file = new java.io.File ( "C:\\Users\\Administrador\\Desktop\\poc.txt" );

        java.beans.XMLDecoder xd = null ;
        try {
            xd = new java.beans.XMLDecoder ( new BufferedInputStream ( new FileInputStream (file)));
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace ();
        }
        Object s2 = xd.readObject ();
        xd.close ();
}
```
